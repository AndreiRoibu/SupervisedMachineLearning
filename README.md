# Supervised Machine Learning
## Motivation
This collection respresents a set codes aiding my learning / recap of basic machine learning algorithms, from their derivation to applications. This repo contains codes for K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Bayes Classifiers, Decision Trees, Perceptrons, some Practical Machine Learning consideratios and code for Building a ML Web Service.

These codes are inspired by a course created by the [Lazy Programmer](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer). More information can be found at these two links:

## Installation
In order to install the packaged, the user will require the presence of Python3 and the [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installer. 

For installation on Linux or OSX, use the following commands. This will create an environment and automatically install all the requirements.

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Alternativelly, run the setup.sh file as follows:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

## Usage
In order to run the solver, type the following commands int the activated python environment. 

```python
python file_name.py
```
